It was erected (along with an adjacent prison and market) during the years 1875-1877 and cost the city almost $360,000."+"\n"+"What the city got for its money, in addition to an architectural gem (it was voted one of the ten most beautiful buildings in America by a poll of architects in the 1880s) was a civil court (on the second floor, where the Adult Reading Room is now) and a police court (now the first-floor Children's Room). The beautiful brick-arched basement (now the Reference Room) was used as a holding area for prisoners on their way to jail or trial."+""+"Scattered about the building were offices and chambers, and looming above it all was - and is - the tower. A hundred feet above the ground, the firewatcher's balcony once commanded an uninterrupted view of Greenwich Village. The bell which summoned volunteer firemen still hangs in the tower.",

intro:"From the time of its founding in 1831 until 1973, New York University housed its library collections in various campus locations. A major gift from Elmer Holmes Bobst and his wife, Mamdouha, enabled the university to bring its various collections together in a new library on Washington Square in 1973. Designed in red sandstone by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is the flagship of the Division of Libraries. Since 2004, a multiphase renovation has transformed six of its twelve library floors and created a versatile Research Commons on floors 4, 5, and 6, to be expanded to 7 in early 2017.",

intro:" The Ottendorfer Branch of the New York Public Library opened in 1884 as New York City's first free public library."+"\n"+"Designed by German-born architect William Schickel, this landmark building combines Queen Anne and neo-Italian Renaissance styles with an exterior ornamented by innovative terracotta putti. The branch was a gift of Oswald Ottendorfer, owner of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung newspaper. At the time, the neighborhood was called Kleindeutschland (\"Little Germany\") and had a population of over 150,000 people of German descent. Ottendorfer wished to provide this community with books to cultivate their minds and assist assimilation into American culture. Half of the 8,000 original books were in German with the other half in English. In this tradition, the branch continues to reflect its community and remains a vital educational and cultural resource for the East Village."+"\n"+"The building, which is a designated New York City landmark, has been completely renovated through the Library's Adopt-a-Branch program, through which private donors join public funders to restore branch libraries. While the original Ottendorfer branch was designed as a bilingual library to serve the German community, the restored library can now better serve its multilingual community and provide an increased level of accessibility to all people. Highlights include the restored, repointed, and cleaned facade, an elevator, air-conditioning system, spacious reading area, new computer lab workstations, and children's floor with story-hour room.",
